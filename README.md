# Project

I built a simple landing page ("look page") for the rapper Eminem using the Shopify Theme Dawn.


## Preparation
- Use the ```eminem_shopify``` directory to run the Shopify Theme on local development.
- Use the ```media_assets``` for any images needed for the landing page.
- Once the theme is pushed to your development store, make sure to assign the ```eminem-lookpage template``` to a new or existing page.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo using the following command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/The1987/eminem-landing-page.git
```

2. CD into the ```eminem_shopify``` directory.

3. Use the [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli/commands) to login into your local environment, switch into a development store, and then push this theme up to your development store.

Note: Make sure to assign the ```eminem-lookpage template``` to a new or existing page.

4. Open the Customizer, and navigate to page you assigned the ```eminem-lookpage template```. Use the Customizer to view sections within the template and to assign assets (ie: images, text, links, etc) to the page. 

Note: Remember to click SAVE and preview url to view.
